1. Are you interested in films about outer space and stars?

Absolutely, Yes! I love such movies due to their unpredictable plot.
When I was a child, I used to watch science fiction movies a lot. I am
really into the one called the MARTIAN. This science fiction
masterpiece has such a very deep meaning

2. Do you want to travel in the outer space?

Of course, I do, it is one of my biggest dreams. This is mainly
because I’ve always wanted to see our planet Earth with my own eyes. I
hope my dream will come true in the future.

3. Have you ever learned about stars and outer space?

Yes, I have. I remember, when I was in high school, there used to be a
subject called Astronomy. Since this subject was compulsory, I had
no other option but to study it. At first, I didn’t like the subject but my
teacher kindled my interest into this subject. He was very experienced
and he taught us about the basics of outer space.

4. Is it important to study stars?

I think that it is very important to study stars because this helps us
explore how the universe started. As the Earth is heavily polluted,
humans should start thinking about finding another planet to live. In
addition, by studying stars we can be aware of possible dangers
coming from outer space to our planet.
