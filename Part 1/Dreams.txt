1. What was your dream when you were a child?

I vividly recall, I used to dream about becoming a pilot in my childhood because I really wanted to fly airplanes and travel the whole world. I watched lots of movies about pilots and their adventures. As I grow older, I realized that it was nearly impossible to make my dream happen as there is no university in Uzbekistan to prepare pilots.

2. Are you the kind of person who sticks to
dreams?

Yes, I'm. I am a kind of person who has a never give up spirit. It means that regardless of what I dream, I work flat out to make them come true. I don't stop pursuing my dreams unless there is a barrier beyond my potential. Only in this case, I may change my opinion on my dreams.
