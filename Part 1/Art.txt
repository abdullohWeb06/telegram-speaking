1. Do you like art?

No. I hate it. I never understand the people who love art. I think it is
just a waste of time and money.

2. Do you think it would be interesting for you to be an artist?

Definitely, no! Being an artist is the last thing I want to do in this life
because I can't even imagine wasting my whole life drawing pictures
or making sculptures.

3. Is there any artwork on the wall in your room?

No, there isnâ€™t. As I am living in a rented flat, we are not allowed to
hang the wall. But in the past when I lived with my family, there used
to be several pictures on the wall of my room.

4. Have you ever visited an art gallery?

Yes, I have once. When I was a freshman at university, I went to one
of the art exhibitions for its opening ceremony. Actually, we were
forced to take part in it by our tutors. So, the only time I went to an art
gallery was against my own will.

5. Do you like modern art or traditional art?

I like neither of them. However, I hate modern art more than traditional
one because traditional art at least has something meaningful in it such
as animals, historical figures or beautiful landscapes. But, most of
modern artworks are just strange drawings of incomprehensible lines.
