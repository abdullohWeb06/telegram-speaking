1. Do you like T-shirts with pictures and prints?

No, I don't. Firstly, they attract others attention and I don't want
people to stare at me. Secondly, I think such T-shirts are childish and
pathetic. So, I like plain ones.

2. Do you usually wear T-shirts?

I wish I did. I'm not allowed to wear a T-shirt because we have a strict
dress code at university: students must wear a black suit, a white shirt
and a tie all the time.

3. Do you like wearing T-shirts?

Of course, I do! They are very comfortable. When I am at home, I
always wear T-shirts and shorts.

4. Would you buy T-shirts as souvenirs on vacation?

I would never spend my money on fancy T-shirts which I can easily
buy for a much lower price in Uzbekistan. It is not a problem to print
something on a T-shirt so that it would look like a souvenir.
