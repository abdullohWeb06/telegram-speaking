1. What's your favorite day of the week?

It is definitely Sunday as it is my only day off. I am usually very busy from Monday to Friday, so I can't get enough rest during those days. However, on Sundays, I am free and I can do whatever I want. That's why I love it.

2. Please describe your typical daily routine.

As I am a creature of habit, I try to follow a strict daily routine. I get accustomed to get up at around 6 o'clock and then I go jogging for about 30 minutes. After that I take a quick shower and have breakfast before going to my work. I come back home at 9 pm and go to bed at 10 p.m. It is my typical daily routine. 

3. What do you usually do on weekends? Honestly 

speaking, I am not really productive on weekends. For the most time, I stay in my bed till midday then I surf the net or watch TV. In the evening, I tend to meet up with my friends. All in all, I try to spend my weekends doing whatever I want.
