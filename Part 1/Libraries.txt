1. Do you often go to the library?

I don't, unfortunately. This is because I’m overwhelmingly busy
now: I study in the mornings and work in the evenings. But in the past, I
used to go to the library almost every day because reading is my
favorite hobby.

2. Are libraries popular in your country?

Of course, they are. Uzbek people especially students love reading. If
you go to any library, it is always full of students. That's why, our
government has set up many libraries throughout the country.

3. Did you go to a library when you were a kid?

Yes, I did. I used to spend a lot of time in our local library reading
books of different genres. I particularly loved adventure novels.

4. What kind people would go to a library to read and study?

It can be anyone who loves reading. For instance, students spend
healthy proportion of their time in libraries. According to statistics,
an average student reads at least 100 pages a day in our country. In
addition, researchers at educational establishments tend to go to the
library, because the sources they need can’t be found other places. So,
they have no other option but to go to the library.
