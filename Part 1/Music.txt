1. Do you often listen to music?

No, I don’t. Because now I have an overwhelmingly busy, hectic
lifestyle due to my study. So, I am not able to listen to music as often as
used to do.

2. What kinds of music do you like to listen to?

I love classical music because I find it very relaxing. When I’m
exhausted after hard work, it helps me to calm down and forget about
all my problems.

3. When did you start listening to that type of music?

I’m not sure about it. I guess, when I was at the age of 10 or 11, I
started listening to this genre. While I was watching a movie, its
soundtrack seemed appealing to me and I fell in love with classical
music. I downloaded the soundtrack immediately and it is still on the top
of my playlist!

4. How do you feel when you listen to it?

Classical music helps me get relaxed and recharge my batteries.
Every time I listen to it, I feel relieved

5. When do you listen to music?

I don’t have any specific time period which I dedicate only for
listening to music. But I tend to listen to music whenever I have
enough free time.

6. How much time do you spend listening to music every day?

I am not sure about this, to be honest. Maybe 20 or 25 minutes at
most. Because I think addiction to music is a waste of time.
