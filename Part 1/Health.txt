I do many different kinds of exercises in the morning. As I have a sedentary lifestyle, I have no free time to do exercises during the day. I always go jogging in the morning and then I do some light exercises, such as pull-ups and push-ups. At weekends I go to gym to lift weight, such as dead lift.

week.

4. What sports help people stay healthy?
