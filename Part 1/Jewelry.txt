1. Why do some people wear a piece of jewelry for a long time?

I think there may be various reasons why people prefer to wear the
same piece of jewelry for ages. Most people wear the same jewelry all
the time as it is a reminder of significant people in their life. Others
wear the same one due to their spiritual beliefs.

2. Do you like wearing jewelry?

No, I don’t. I have a strong stance against it because of my religious
belief. In our religion, men are not allowed to wear jewelry especially
golden one

3. What type of jewelry do you like to buy?

It depends. If I am buying it for my mother, I prefer to buy heavy and
expensive jewelry like a necklace. In other cases, I buy rings for others.

4. Have you ever sent someone jewelry as a gift?

Yes, I have. As jewelry is one of the most adored gifts for women, I
like giving jewelry as a gift. For example, on my mother’s last birthday,
I bought a golden necklace, which cost me an arm and a leg. But
when my mother saw it, she was over the moon because she didn’t
expect like this gift.
