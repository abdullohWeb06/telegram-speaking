1. How do you feel in the morning after you stay up late?

I feel restless. And it is always difficult to get out of bed. Even alarm
clocks can’t help me to wake up early. As we humans we need a certain
amount of sleep, to be active during the day. That’s why, I try not to
stay late.

2 What were you doing when you stayed up late last time?

Let me think. It happened about a couple of weeks ago. I had an
upcoming exam so I had to stay late to be fully prepared for the exam.
I felt exhausted while doing homework but when I accomplished the
task, I felt the sense of satisfaction.

3. Do you go to sleep early or stay up late?

The former. As my study begins at 8: 30 in the morning, I always try to
go to bed as early as possible. But sometimes I may stay late when I
have a due exam. But it doesn’t happen a lot maybe once a month.
