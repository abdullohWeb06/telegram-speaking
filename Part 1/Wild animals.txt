1. What's your favorite wild animal?

I love wolves more than other wild animals. Firstly, they are the wildest and ruthless predators. It is possible to train the powerful wild beasts like lion or tiger in a circus by trainers. But it is practically impossible to train a wolf. On top of that, they have some qualities that even humans don't always have such as loyalty to their partner.

2. Are there any wild animals in your
country? 

I think so. There is a huge biodiversity in Uzbekistan. This is because there are different natural habitats for animals ranging from forests to deserts. For example, in our country's deserts we can find snakes, reptiles 
and maybe some bird species.

3. Have you ever seen wild animals?

Yes, I have. I saw wild animals in their natural habitats and captivity as well. As I was born and grew up in a small town close to mountains, I saw a lot of wild animals in my childhood. Also, after I had come to Tashkent, I went to the zoo several times. There, I have seen many different wild animals such as lions, camels, monkeys and even giraffes.

4. Where can we see wild animals?

In my opinion, there are only two ways of doing this. First one is going into the wild and observing wild animals in their natural habitats. But if don't have a chance, we can simply can go to the zoo to see them.

5. Do you like watching animals in the zoo?

No, I don't. In my opinion, we don't have a right to keep animals in captivity. They should live in wherever they want. That's why, I don't like to visit the zoo. But I must confess that in my childhood, I used to go to the zoo a lot. Because at that time I didn't know anything about animal conservation.
