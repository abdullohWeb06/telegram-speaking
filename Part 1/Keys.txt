1. Do you usually bring a lot of keys with you?

Unfortunately, Yes. This is because I have to lock and unlock a
number of doors on a daily basis, for example the door of my house,
workplace and etc.

2. Have you ever locked yourself out?

Yes, I have. Only once in my life. It happened when I was studying at
school. At that time, my parents went somewhere and gave me the keys
of our house. So, I had to unlock the door, get into the house and spend
the night by myself. Unfortunately, I lost the keys and had to spend the
night in my neighbor’s house.

3. Do you think it’s a good idea to leave your keys with a neighbor?

It depends on the situation. If you are going away somewhere for a
long period, it is advisable to leave your keys with your neighbor to
look after your pets and flowers. But If you have to leave your keys
because you have only one key in your family, it is better to duplicate
this key.

4. Have you ever lost your keys?

Unfortunately, Yes! As I am a kind of absent-minded person, it’s my
biggest problem: I usually put my keys somewhere and can’t remember
where.
