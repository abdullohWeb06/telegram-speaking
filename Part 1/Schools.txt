1. Did you go to a good school?

I did. I went to one of the most prestigious high schools in my city. It
was far from the place I lived. So, my parents sacrificed their time and
money because they wanted me to get quality education.
(If you are still a school student, the speaking examiner will ask the
following question:)

3. What changes would you like to see in your school?

The school I studied needs reconstruction as soon as possible. Its
building is too old, I think it must have been built at least 50 or 60 years
ago and therefore unsafe. I donâ€™t think it is able to withstand
earthquakes, for example.
