1. Is it difficult for you to stay focused on something?

Absolutely not! I'm a very focused person. It's nearly almost impossible to distract me when I am doing something regardless of what it is. Concentration is one of my strong points that I am always proud of.

2. What do you do to improve your concentration?

I use several methods to enhance my concentration level. For me, the most useful way is doing sports exercises. For example, when I do push-ups or pull- ups I keep my concentration, others I fail. That's why, I always try to be engaged in sports. Also, when I have to focused on my job, I switch off my mobile as it is number 1 distractor for me. Because a random notification on the screen may 
distract me

There are several situations when it is difficult to concentrate, such as when I'm hungry, nervous, or anxious about something. In addition, when I am in a noisy place, I can't concentrate properly.

4. In what situations do you need to
concentrate? 

In my opinion, we must be concentrated all the time, but I must confess that there are certain points where we should be focused more than ever. For example, when I am behind the wheel of my car, I need to be concentrated. Because any small mistake may cost someone's life. What's more, during the turning points of my life, such as a job interview or a first meeting with my partners I try to be concentrated.

5. Is it easy for you to do two things simultaneously?

I think multitasking doesn't exist. I learned how to carry out two things at the same time. it will still have a negative impact on my productivity and efficiency levels. Therefore, I always prefer to complete the first task and then do the second one..
