1. Do you prefer buying things in big companies or from small
businesses?

It depends on the price of the product I want to buy. If it is a high-
end product, I would go for big companies as their products are in
good quality. On top of that for the most time big companies have
insurance policy meaning that if their product is faulty, your damage is
fully covered by them. But if I need low-end products, I buy it from
the nearest shopping center.

2. Do you know many small businesses?

No, I donâ€™t. Since I moved to my current flat recently, I am not
familiar with small businesses located in my neighborhood. But I
know, there are tons of small businesses ranging from cafes to
shopping centers as my neighborhood is in the downtown.
