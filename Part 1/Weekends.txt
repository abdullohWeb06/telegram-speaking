1)What do you do in your spare time during weekdays?

It depends on the situation. For example, when I'm alone at home, I
prefer to watch TV as it is my favorite hobby. By watching TV, I can
improve my mood. When I'm with my friends, we tend to go out or
sometimes play football together.


2)What do you usually do at the weekends?

Honestly, I tend to be lazier at the weekends compared to weekdays. I
stay in my bed longer till around midday. Because I enjoy doing
nothing in my day offs. Then, I usually do my household chores such
as cleaning my room or washing my clothes. In the evening I always
meet my friends and eat out with them. Also, from time to time, I go to
extra course.

3)What did you do last weekend?

Let me think . As I had an upcoming exam, I had to review all
previous lessons. Also, I read all my notes three times to be fully
prepared for the exam. And in the evening, I went out to recharge my
battery before the exam.

4)Do you think that having free time at the weekends is important?

I think having free time is extremely vital for everyone. We are
always busy with our studies and work during weekdays. That's why
we need some spare time to unwind at the weekends. It is very
important to be prepared for the next week and improve study
efficiency.

5) Do you think men and women do the same things in their free time?

No, I don't think so. They do completely different activities in their
free time. As for women, as it is their responsibility, they should do
household chores such as cleaning the room, cooking and washing.
Sometimes, they can go shopping in their free time. When it comes to
men, they usually meet their friends or play football.
